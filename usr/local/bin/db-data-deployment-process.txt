1) Data Engineering grp announces DB on dev mysql server as "ready for QA"
2) Determine datestamp VERSION id (e.g. "20181109") based on latest timestamp on mysql data files (*.MYD) for specified database
     If incremental update, with no schema or sproc parameter changes, use previous date, but append 'u1' or 'u#' where # is update identifier.
     For example, a minor, no-code-post update to a poseidon data set could be called "debt_20180909u1", attached to database "debt_20180909",
     with the intent to keep database name the same as prior, so no code post is needed to apply the update to production services.
3) Determine which DB server and SAN the source database lives on (e.g. devmysql01, devmysql03, or devgalmysql01, and pure1 or pure3)
4) Some smaller databases cannot be cloned, since they don't live on a dedicated volume attached to the source DB server.  For these, a new
     volume must be created on the QA DB server (qa-posmysql01 for poseidon DBs, qa-mysql01 for SEO, or qa-galmysql01)
